Build, visualize, and evaluate the Bayesian MMM using the latest version of PyMC.

This report presents the findings of a Bayesian Mixed-Media Model (MMM) analysis conducted for Company X's online shop. Using advanced statistical techniques leveraging the PyMC framework, we've evaluated the effectiveness of seven distinct marketing channels to optimize advertising spend.

Some finding from Analysis of raw Revenue and Channel Spending data:
1.	Spending Patterns: There's significant variation in spend across the seven channels. Channel 7 consistently receives the highest budget allocation. Channels 3 and 5 also receive substantial investment. These channels likely have lower decay parameters (0.3-0.5) indicating more immediate effects on revenue. Channels 1, 2, 4, and 6 receive smaller budget allocations
2.	Seasonality: Clear spending peaks occur around October-November and April-May each year. These likely align with seasonal promotions or holiday campaigns. Summer periods (July-August) typically show reduced spending. Channel 3 and Channel 7 show corresponding spending increases.
